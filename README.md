A highly motivated and technologically savvy graduate, who has recently completed their master’s degree with a 1:1 honours degree. Currently participating in a Software Engineer Bootcamp at Makers Academy to build upon a keen scientific interest and further develop my software skills and knowledge in a practical and fast-paced environment. Eventual career goal is to improve people’s lives and promote sustainability in the industry, with the longer-term aspiration of becoming a fully qualified and experienced Chartered  Engineer.
